FullRSSList_1_2.py

This script takes in articles (posts) from RssArticles_1.py (via `posts`),
extracts the desired fields (title, summary, link, and published)
fixes data format issues (like dates), and provides the final list as 'MyTheFinalList'.

Students: 
 - Ensure your 'RssArticles_1.py' is in the same folder (or adjust imports accordingly).
 - Examine how 'posts' is structured, and fix any date format issues carefully.
