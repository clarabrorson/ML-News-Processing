"""
MLModelReturns_4.py

This script will:
  - Import 'MyTheFinalList' from FullRSSList_1_2.py
  - Import the trained model (best_clf_pipeline) + supporting objects (categories, vectorizer, etc.) 
    from MLModelMLC_3.py
  - Use the model to predict categories for the newly fetched RSS articles.
  - Combine the predictions with the final list from 'MyTheFinalList' and possibly produce a
    validated dictionary (validDict).

Students:
 - Complete the pseudo code to transform text, get predictions,
   and merge them with the 'MyTheFinalList'.

def main():
    # Pseudo code steps:

    # 1. Take the final text from 'printdepositlist' (title+summary).
    #    If your "MyTheFinalList" has its own text, decide which you want to feed to the model.
    #    For instance:
    #       my_text = printdepositlist

    # 2. Clean up or filter empty strings from 'my_text' if necessary.
    #       my_text_no_empty = [t for t in my_text if t.strip() != ""]

    # 3. Transform text with the same vectorizer used during training:
    #       my_text_transformed = vectorizer.transform(my_text_no_empty)

    # 4. Use best_clf_pipeline to get probabilities:
    #       predictions = best_clf_pipeline.predict_proba(my_text_transformed)

    # 5. Compare each probability to a threshold to decide which categories apply:
    #       threshold = 0.3
    #       results = {}  # dict of text -> list of predicted categories
    #       for idx, pvector in enumerate(predictions):
    #           text = my_text_no_empty[idx]
    #           # results[text] = ...
    #           # loop through each category probability in pvector

    # 6. Combine 'results' with 'MyTheFinalList'.
    #    Typically, you want to match each text to the corresponding item in MyTheFinalList.
    #    That might mean using indexes if the order is guaranteed to match.

    # 7. Create a final list of dicts (e.g., key_list = ['title','summary','link','published','topic'])
    #    Each dict must have the correct shape (like in your example).
    #    finalDict = [dict(zip(key_list, v)) for v in combinedList]

    # 8. (Optional) Validate the final dictionaries with a JSON schema:
    #     schema = {
    #       "type": "object",
    #       ...
    #     }
    #     valid_list = []
    #     for item in finalDict:
    #         try:
    #             jsonschema.validate(instance=item, schema=schema)
    #             valid_list.append(item)
    #         except:
    #             pass
    # 
    #     validDict = valid_list
    #
    # 9. Print or return 'validDict' so it can be imported in DbTransfer_5.py
